let's not give our characters a jump capability.
Need to implement the no movement after death.
Need to fix up the radius for the attacks

Need to add perspective dynamic:
1. by pressing right arrow once, it remains in right mode,
2. by pressing left arrow once, it remains in left mode,

hence dual persepective and dual animateable

(Abstract away and refactor the code later)

-------------------

1. dynamics: 
    1. parry //
    2. perspective
    3. dash
    4. jump(undefined)

2. enemy automated //
3. health bar's inteface more like flow 

------------------

0. Instructions display on right 
1. more backgrounds - more levels
2. narrated story
3. dialogues
4. menu screen - starting screen
5. Level display or something
6. sound
